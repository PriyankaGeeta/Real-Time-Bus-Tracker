# Real Time Bus Tracker

### This code is about Tracking the Bus in Real - Time on the map.

Here's how to interact with the interface:

Once the page loads, click on the **"Show stops between MIT and Harvard"** button. A blue color location icon will start moving fro one stop to another as per its real time location.


### How to Run:

You can download the ZIP file by clicking the CODE from the  [Real Time Bus Tracker Github Repository](https://github.com/PriyankaGeeta/Real-Time-Bus-Tracker). Double click on the Index.html file and run that in your browser.


### Roadmap of future improvements: 

  I am planning to add a real - time traffic data collector and estimated time of arrival.
